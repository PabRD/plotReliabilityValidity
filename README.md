# plotReliabilityValidity
Quicly plot correlation plots for validity and reliability studies with associated statistics

______________________________________
Validity:
- bias: mean difference between the two methods
- TEE (Typical Error of Estimate): the differences standard deviation                                 (Hopkins, 2015)
- TEE%: TEE applied to the criterion group average
- r: Pearson's r

___________________________________
Reliability:
- TEM (Typical Error of Measurement): differences standard deviation divided by square root of 2      (Hopkins, 2015)
- TEM%: TEM applied to the test1 group average
- ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients): Reported as "ICC2,1" (Shrout and Fleiss convention) or "Two-way mixed effects, absolute agreement, single rater/measurement" (McGraw and Wong convention) for test-retest reliability study (Koo and Li, 2016).
- r: Pearson's r
- SWC (Smallest Worthwile Change): 0.2 times the between participant standard deviation
